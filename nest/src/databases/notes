1. first determine which data I want to use for the bird sightings
2. get the data from the VT bird species and make into CSV. Go through the CSV and take out columns that I don't want and escape out quotes
3. Do I want to iterate through an array and only take the items I want? Do I want to call it back as a csv and put it in excel and do it manually?
4. seed bird sightings table... decide which columns I want to use.. Maybe only pull like 20 records?
5. Create a middleware that goes and looks up / patch/upserts user, gets user Id, then passes to post request to submit bird sighting data
6. need to also populate birdspeciesID. this should already be available on the frontend from the picklist value.
7. if i have time i should cache the frontend or backend data for bird species so I can look through it easier?
8. validation and sanitization if i have more time
9. create DTOs if I have time

**seeding completed, now what?**

1. create route to create new record in bird_sighting table
2. create middleware to look up user first then add if not there, then pass userId to bird_sighting route
3. create route to get all recent bird sightings/\
4. get request to get all bird species on mount groupby
